This Repo. has 3 Folder with different projects on machine learning Structural Data.
1) Detect Heart Disease using patient data :
   Objective : Build a system that can predict if a patient has heart disease. Explore the data, understand the
features, and figure out an approach.
You can see how the Heart Disease predicted with different algorithm of Machine Learning.
2 ) Detect Lung Cancer using patient diagnosis data:
   Objective : Build a system that can predict the survival of a patient given details of the patient. Explore the
data to understand the features and figure out an approach.
How the model face the high dimention data and handling that crucial data and predict the Lung Cancer
3 ) Predict Vehicle Prices using Vehicle dataset:
   Objective : Build a system that can predict the prices for vehicles using data on Vehicle specifications,
make, etc. Explore the data to understand the features and figure out an approach.
With Linear Regression and other algorithm used to predict the price of Vehicle
